## More Prompts (Longer)

```
"Perform a detailed time series analysis on [data type] over [time period]. Identify seasonality, trends, and cyclical patterns. Apply techniques such as decomposition, ARIMA modeling, or exponential smoothing to forecast future values and evaluate the accuracy of the predictions."
```

```
"Conduct a sentiment analysis on [data type]. Utilize natural language processing techniques to categorize sentiments (positive, negative, neutral) and identify trends or spikes in sentiment over time. Provide insights into the key drivers of sentiment changes."
```

```
"Develop a classification model to categorize [data type] into [classes/categories]. Use supervised learning methods (e.g., decision trees, random forests, or logistic regression), evaluate model performance using metrics like precision, recall, and F1 score, and explain the most significant predictors."
```

```
"Perform clustering analysis on [data type] using unsupervised machine learning methods such as K-means or hierarchical clustering. Identify and describe distinct segments, provide visualizations of cluster distributions, and explain the key features driving cluster formation."
```

```
"Analyze [dataset] to detect anomalies using techniques like statistical methods (e.g., Z-scores) or machine learning approaches (e.g., Isolation Forest or Autoencoders). Explain potential causes and the impact of these anomalies on the overall system or business."
```

```
"Perform a regression analysis to quantify the relationship between [dependent variable] and [independent variables]. Test multiple models (e.g., linear, polynomial, or multivariate regression), validate using R-squared and residuals, and highlight the most significant predictors."
```

```
"Conduct an in-depth exploratory data analysis on [dataset]. Summarize data distributions, identify missing values, visualize relationships using scatter plots, box plots, and heatmaps, and provide a summary of preliminary insights and potential data quality issues."
```

```
"Test the hypothesis that [hypothesis statement]. Apply appropriate statistical tests (e.g., t-tests, chi-square, or ANOVA), interpret the results, and determine whether to reject the null hypothesis. Provide a detailed explanation of assumptions and limitations."
```

```
"Use dimensionality reduction techniques such as PCA (Principal Component Analysis) or t-SNE (t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) to reduce the complexity of [high-dimensional dataset]. Visualize the reduced dimensions and explain how they capture the key patterns and variability in the data."
```

```
"Perform a cohort analysis on [data type] to track and compare the behavior of different groups over time. Segment cohorts based on [criteria] and analyze their retention, churn, or growth metrics. Present key findings through visualizations and interpret trends across cohorts."
