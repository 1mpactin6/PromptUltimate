### Introduction to LLMs (Large Language Models)

Large Language Models (LLMs) are a class of machine learning models that have been trained on vast amounts of text data, enabling them to generate human-like text based on the prompts they receive. These models can be fine-tuned to specialize in various domains such as creative writing, customer service, data analysis, and more. They work by predicting the next word or phrase in a sequence of text based on the context provided by the input.

Different LLMs like ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and Deepseek have unique characteristics based on their training data, architectures, and usage goals. Although all LLMs can be prompted to perform tasks such as summarization, translation, and conversation, each has a unique prompt style or preferred format. Below, we explore specific templates for each of these models and offer examples and explanations for when and how to use them.
