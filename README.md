## Prompt Engineering

Prompt Engineering is the ability of creating prompts that maximizes the effectiveness of LLMs, ensuring that the response is both accurate and relevant to the user's needs. Prompt engineering is a key aspect the correct and efficient usage of LLMs.

## Prompting

To create good prompts regarding to your specific desired outputs, consider think as how you want the Model (or LLM) to think. For stuff about Note, ask it to generate information regarding in Visualization and Structure, while in Note/Bullet form. If you want the Model to enhance your text, try asking it to "Enhance carity", "Reconsider overall structure overflow", and "Redetermined the usage of transitions."
